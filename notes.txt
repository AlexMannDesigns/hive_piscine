NOTES

allowed functions: exit, open, close, write, read, malloc, free.

Aim : find the biggest square, avoiding obstacles

- the map will be passed as an argument, so the program must handle parameters:

Number of lines, empty char, obstacle char, full char.
eg: 9.ox

- empty chars must be replaced by full chars to represent the biggest possible square.
- If there is more than one solution, the topmost, then leftmost, will be chosen.

Valid map:
- all lines same length
- smallest possible is 1x1 (at least one line of one box?)
- At each end of line, thereâ€™s a line break.
- first line will introduce the valid chars
- IF THE MAP IS INVALID, PROGRAM DISPLAYS: map error\n THEN MOVES TO NEXT MAP


- exec must be called 'bsq'
- must pass norm
- submission directory must have a file called 'author', containing logins: amann:ssulkuma
- if no args are passed, program must read from stdin
- Makefile needed

int lines
char empty
char obstacle
char full

read("the file")
lines = 9;
empty = '.';
